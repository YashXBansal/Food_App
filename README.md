    - MongoDB
    - Node.js

    - Functionality of authentication using JWT.
    - User can easily create account and login
    - displaying data of food items 
    - Food items can be added to cart on clicking Add to Cart


- Learnings
    - I got to learn about how to create a full stack mern app 
    - I got to know how the JWTs work and how to store them inside the local storage
    - I got to learn more about how to play with router both on frontend (for routing to pages) and backend (for creating routes)
    - This app still has lots of bugs and other issues, but still this project gave me a lot more exposure
    - I'll try to improve this app in future with better learnings. 

- How to start this app? 
    - Clone the repo into your local machine.
    - `cd client`
    - `npm i`
    - ` npm run dev`

    - Off to backend side
    
    - ` cd ../server`
    - ` npm i `
    - `npm start`
    
- Note : As this was my first proper frontend projects the database entry for displaying food items at hero section is static and hardcoded inside my own MongoDB cluster, so if anyone clones this repo will not be a able to see it until you create one.
